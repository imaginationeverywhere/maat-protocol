# Merge PRs to Develop

Review and merge one or more pull requests into the develop branch.

## Usage

```bash
# By PR numbers
/merge-to-develop [PR_NUMBERS]
/merge-to-develop 123
/merge-to-develop 123 456 789

# By GitHub URL - analyzes ALL open PRs
/merge-to-develop https://github.com/org/repo/pulls
/merge-to-develop https://github.com/imaginationeverywhere/ppsv-charities/pulls

# Auto-find approved PRs
/merge-to-develop --all-approved

# From worktrees
/merge-to-develop --from-worktrees

# Review only (no merge)
/merge-to-develop --review-only https://github.com/org/repo/pulls
```

## Arguments

- `PR_NUMBERS` - Space-separated list of PR numbers to review and merge
- `URL` - GitHub pulls URL (e.g., `https://github.com/org/repo/pulls`) - fetches ALL open PRs
- `--all-approved` - Find and merge all approved PRs targeting develop
- `--from-worktrees` - Create PRs from completed worktree branches and merge
- `--review-only` - Analyze and report on PRs without merging any
- `--dry-run` - Review PRs without merging
- `--squash` - Squash commits when merging
- `--no-squash` - Create merge commit (default for develop)

## Workflow

### Step 0: Parse Input (URL or PR Numbers)

#### If GitHub URL provided:
```bash
# Extract owner and repo from URL
# URL: https://github.com/imaginationeverywhere/ppsv-charities/pulls
# → owner: imaginationeverywhere
# → repo: ppsv-charities

# Fetch ALL open PRs targeting develop
gh pr list --repo [owner]/[repo] --base develop --state open \
  --json number,title,state,mergeable,reviewDecision,headRefName,baseRefName,commits,additions,deletions,changedFiles,statusCheckRollup,reviews,labels,author

# Also identify PRs from worktrees/auto-claude
gh pr list --repo [owner]/[repo] --state open --search "auto-claude in:head" \
  --json number,title,headRefName,reviewDecision,mergeable
```

### Step 1: Fetch PR Information

For each PR number provided (or from URL):

```bash
# Get PR details
gh pr view [PR_NUMBER] --json number,title,state,mergeable,reviewDecision,headRefName,baseRefName,commits,additions,deletions,changedFiles

# Get PR diff for review
gh pr diff [PR_NUMBER]

# Get PR checks status
gh pr checks [PR_NUMBER]
```

### Step 2: Review Each PR

For each PR, analyze:

1. **Merge Target Validation**
   - Confirm base branch is `develop`
   - If targeting main instead, warn (may need different workflow)

2. **Status Checks**
   - All CI checks must pass
   - No failing or pending required checks

3. **Review Status**
   - Should have at least one approval (can be relaxed for feature branches)
   - No changes requested

4. **Merge Conflicts**
   - Check `mergeable` status
   - If conflicts exist, report and provide resolution guidance

5. **Code Review**
   - Review the diff for:
     - Code quality issues
     - Test coverage
     - Documentation
     - Breaking changes to develop

### Step 3: Generate Review Report

```markdown
## PR Merge Review Report (Develop)

### PR #[NUMBER]: [TITLE]
- **Branch:** [head] → develop
- **Type:** [feature/fix/chore/auto-claude]
- **Status:** [APPROVED/PENDING/READY]
- **Checks:** [PASSING/FAILING/PENDING]
- **Mergeable:** [YES/NO/CONFLICTS]
- **Changes:** +[additions] -[deletions] ([files] files)
- **Review Notes:** [Observations]

### Summary
- Ready to merge: [X] PRs
- Needs review: [Y] PRs
- Has conflicts: [Z] PRs
```

### Step 4: Merge PRs

For each PR that passes checks:

```bash
# Merge commit (default for develop - preserves history)
gh pr merge [PR_NUMBER] --merge --delete-branch

# Or squash if requested
gh pr merge [PR_NUMBER] --squash --delete-branch
```

### Step 5: Post-Merge Actions

After successful merges:

```bash
# Update local develop
git fetch origin develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Verify merges
git log --oneline -10

# Clean up merged worktree branches
git branch -d [merged-branch-names]
```

## Worktree Integration

When using `--from-worktrees`:

```bash
# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# For each completed worktree (has QA sign-off):
# 1. Check if PR exists
gh pr list --head [branch-name] --json number,state

# 2. Create PR if doesn't exist
gh pr create --base develop --head [branch-name] --title "[Title]" --body "[Description]"

# 3. Review and merge
```

### Auto-Claude Worktree Workflow

For auto-claude branches (from Auto Claude builds):

```bash
# Find all auto-claude branches
git branch -a | grep "auto-claude/"

# Check each for QA completion
# Look for qa_report.md with "PASSED" status

# Create PRs for completed branches
for branch in $(git branch | grep "auto-claude/"); do
  gh pr create --base develop --head $branch --fill
done
```

git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts with develop"
git push

# Re-run the merge command
/merge-to-develop [PR_NUMBER]
```

## Batch Operations

  | jq -r '.[] | select(.reviewDecision == "APPROVED") | .number'
```

### Merge All Auto-Claude PRs with QA Sign-off

```bash
# Find auto-claude PRs
gh pr list --base develop --state open --search "auto-claude in:title" --json number,title
```
