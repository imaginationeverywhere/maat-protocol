# Communication Costs

All communication providers and their costs. These are baked into the Technology Fee or Voice tier — customers never see provider names.

## Provider Stack

|---------|----------|------|--------|
| Email (transactional) | AWS SES | $0.10/1,000 emails | Active |
| Email (marketing blasts) | AWS SES | $0.10/1,000 emails | Active |
| SMS (OTP, notifications) | AWS SNS | $0.00645/text (US) | Active |
